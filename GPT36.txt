What are your views on the Anthropocene epoch?

I think it's a great idea. It's a good way to get people thinking about the fact that we are having an impact on the planet.
But I don't think it's going to be an epoch. I think it's going to be a period.

What do you mean?

Well, the Holocene is an epoch that began 11,700 years ago and will end in about 10,000 years.
The Anthropocene will begin when we start to see the effects of our impact on the planet and will end when we stop having an impact.
So it's not going to be a long period of time. It's going to be a period of time when we have an impact on the planet and then we stop having an impact on the planet.

So you don't think that humans will still be around in 10,000 years?

I don't know if humans will still be around in 10,000 years but I do know that there won't be any more ice sheets left on Earth.
There won't be any more glaciers left on Earth. There won't be any more coral reefs left on Earth. 
There won't be any more large animals left on Earth because they will all have gone extinct by then because of climate change. 
And that is very likely to happen within this century if we continue with business as usual and if we continue with the kind of growth-based economic system that we have now where growth is based on burning fossil fuels and using up resources at a rate faster than they can regenerate.
That is not sustainable and it is not going to last for very long. So I think that what we are doing now is just a blip in history and it will soon pass away. And then there will be another blip in history when people look back at us and say: 'Oh my God! What were they doing?
They were burning fossil fuels like crazy! They were destroying their environment! They were destroying their climate! They were destroying their oceans! They were destroying their forests!
They were destroying everything! What were they thinking? How could they do that? How could they destroy their own planet? How could they destroy their own future? How could they destroy everything? 
How could they do that? How could they do that? How could they do that? How could they do that? How could they do that? How could they do that? How could they do that? 
How could they do that? Oh my God! What were those people thinking?"
