What is the meaning of life?

I know people who have been given a diagnosis of terminal illness. I've tried to imagine what it would be like
if I were told that my life was coming to an end, and what I would do with the time that was left to me.
Would I spend it on the Internet? Or would I use it to think about what is really important?

I have no idea how long we are going to live, but some things are certain:
in the future we will all die, and our lives will end. So when we ask ourselves what is the meaning of life,
the only honest answer is that there is no answer; there is no meaning. This may sound depressing or absurd,
but it doesn't have to be. The fact that life has no meaning doesn't mean that it isn't worth living; 
on the contrary, accepting this fact can make our lives much richer and more fulfilling.

The Meaning of Life


Imagine you had three weeks left to live. What would you do with your time? Would you go online and read all the news stories you had missed? 
Would you watch every film you had ever wanted to see? Would you try everything on your bucket list bungee jumping, skydiving or climbing Mount Everest?
Or would you spend your last three weeks with family and friends, saying goodbye and making amends for any quarrels or misunderstandings you had had with them?

Does Life Have a Purpose?


Why does everything exist? Why are we here? Does anything have a purpose or a meaning? These questions are as old as humanity itself;
they have been asked for thousands of years by philosophers and theologians alike. In every age these questions have inspired great minds:
from Aristotle and Plato in ancient Greece to Augustine in early Christianity to Spinoza in seventeenth-century Holland
these thinkers spent their entire lives trying to find answers to them.

In his book The Meaning of Life (2007), Stephen Cave gives an overview of different theories about why we exist:some say we are here because God wants us here;
others say we are here because our genes want us here;others say that our reason wants us here; others say our nature wants us here; 
still others say our environment wants us here;some say society wants us here; while others say history wants us here The list goes on
But after considering each theory he concludes that none of them provides a satisfactory explanation for why we exist:
The truth is that nobody really knows why we are here or whether anything has a purpose at all. 
It seems most likely that there simply isn't any purpose at least not one which could explain why all these different things exist: 
reason, nature, genes, society etc., rather than nothing at all It seems reasonable therefore just to accept this fact
namely that nothing really has a purpose rather than looking for some other explanation which might perhaps turn out not even to be possible anyway
Cave then goes on to examine other questions such as What should I do with my life? What makes me happy?, What makes me unhappy?,
How should I treat other people?, How should society be organized? but his conclusion applies equally well to these questions too: 
When all these questions have been answered satisfactorily (which they never can be) then one has reached one layer down into the onion skin of existence
one layer nearer its core but one layer only! And so one carries on asking further questions until eventually
one reaches bedrock rock bottom as it were whereupon one realizes there is nothing else left further down at all!
There just isn't any further question left unanswered! At least not any important question at all! And so having realized this one either gives up asking
questions altogether or else just accepts whatever happens without questioning it anymore! That way lies peace! To stop asking questions means giving
up trying always consciously to understand everything in terms of some sort of general theory about why things happen as they do! 
It means instead just taking things as they come without worrying too much about them! If something happens which makes me unhappy then instead of trying always consciously
somehow rationally explain why it happened (and thereby perhaps prevent something similar from happening again
